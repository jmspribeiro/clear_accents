# Clear accents repository

## ./src/generate_example_tree.sh
This script generates an example tree on the _"workspace"_ folder

## ./src/clear_accents.sh
This script generates a special tree in _"no_accent_folder"_ inside _"workspace"_.
The tree should be exactly the same as inside _"workspace"_ until the last folder level where it is replaced by a symbolik link.
All path and symbolik link should be accent free.
